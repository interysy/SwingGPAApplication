# SwingGPAApplication
A simple application, which can be used to calculate your GPA based on the module grades given at the University Of Glasgow. 
 
# How to use 
The modules taken into account when calculating GPA are held in a list on the left hand side of the GUI, new modules can be added using the '+' and any module can be removed using the '-' button. The user is also able to add some pre written modules to limit the hassle of adding a new module using the 'add a preloaded module' button. Every custom module the user adds is saved in a local text file , for future use (will be held in the preloaded module list).  
 
Before using it is necessary to have a modules.txt file in the src directory of the project.  Once the requirement is met the app can be launched by running the main method in the file called "SwingGPACalc.java". 
 
# On-going work  
Although I have completed this small project, I have decided to add extra calculation features including : What exam grade did I get based on the overall grade? and What do I need to get to achieve target grade?. I have started to work on these and will soon be able to upload this in the second version of this application.
